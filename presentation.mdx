# CMS Setup v3

> 🚧 a work-in-progress

---

# The Problem

- wide variety of project types
- low-budget sites have too much technical debt
- higher-budget sites spend too long on setup
- improvements aren't shared between projects

---

# Goals

- share improvements when it makes sense
- make setup a faster
- spend more of budget on what matters

---

# Past Setup - v1.0

✅ little setup<br />
❌ siloed knowledge<br />
❌ technical debt

---

# Current Setup - v2.0

✅ fewer silos<br />
❌ more setup time<br />
❌ sometimes over-engineered

---

# Next Setup - v3.0

✅ reduced setup<br />
✅ fewer silos<br />
🤷‍♂ complicated parts are shared

---

# Technical Changes

- server-side rendering is separate project
- CMS connection is separate project
- allow front-end to request what it needs
- **WIP:** single domain again (no `webapi.server.com`)
- **WIP:** easily test against different environments
- **WIP:** create new setup with oneliner
