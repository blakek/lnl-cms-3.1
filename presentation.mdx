# CMS Sites v3.1

## NOTE

This should change over time like any other project.

---

## CHANGELOG

…how did we get here?

---

### v1.0 - vanilla CMS

✅ little setup<br />
❌ siloed knowledge<br />
❌ technical debt<br />
❌ difficult to share improvements between projects

---

### v2.0 - Salata

🟡 somewhat fewer silos<br />
❌ more setup time<br />
❌ difficult to share improvements between projects

---

### v3.0 - EurekaMDF

✅ reduced setup<br />
✅ fewer silos<br />
🟡 complicated parts extracted<br />
❌ definitely some misses

---

### v3.1 - WIP

✅ reduced setup<br />
✅ fewer silos<br />
✅ fewer complicated parts in project<br />
✅ _slightly_ more flexible page layouts<br />
🤷‍♂ theme props<br />
❌ still more needed

---

### Technical Changes - v2.0..v3.0

- server-side rendering
  - per-project => Next.js
- CMS connection
  - per-project => separate GS&F project
- project setup
  - per-project => separate GS&F project
- page props
  - mostly combined => each page requests own props
- domains
  - multiple => single domain (no `webapi.example.com`)
- test different environments
  - difficult => command-based (`yarn start:prod`)

---

### Technical Changes - v3.0..v3.1

- CMS connection
  - GS&F project => [WPGraphQL](https://www.wpgraphql.com/)
- tweaks to page structure in CMS
- WIP - remove plugins.json
- WIP - use Next.js to cache page data

---

## Potential Improvements

- better forms
- more flexible layouts
- test selective WP plugin integration
- test with some WP plugins (e.g. WooCommerce)
- maybe move base theme to separate project
- improve experience adding custom plugins to projects

Example Section

This is an example section to show the v3.1 CMS integration. The layout should be fairly flexible to create informational page. In it, you should find that:

<ul>
  <li>HTML should be allowed</li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://ddg.gg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
      External links
    </a>{" "}
    should work properly
  </li>
</ul>
